/* Authentication using firebase*/
===================================

1. create the project like Auth
2.after it is opening the page for that we have to do 2 steps
  i) Authentication  
  ii)Configuration process

 i) Authentication :
 ===================
 a)in side of that page there is a  build dashboard in that choose Authentication 
 b)then in that there sign in method choose whatever we want like email and password process that should be enable because we are using the email and password 

ii)Configuration process:
============================
a) in side click on project overview in that go to project settings in that go to last choose the devices for example in that i'm using the web app 
b) after click that Add Firebase to your web app will open  

3. in the frontend:
=================
 "when we are doing handleChange in input fields the name and value should be the same"
   a)sign up: onClick----> createUserWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password) -->to create a new account
   b)sign in: onClick----> signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password) -->check the account

  " if you want to display the user, current user is login or not"
  for that --> in app folder in that create the useEffect -->onAuthStateChanged()--> to display in browser with the help of this method
4. if all the creditals are right then the creditals are check in the firebase database in Authentication dashboard

5. after sign in it will redirect to the home page in that user details will be display and if user wants to sign out 
    sign out---> signOut() ---> this method is used for sign out from the auth function from firebase.js
